# MSI Installer (WiX)

Little Launcher ships as a **per-user MSI** built with WiX Toolset 5. No elevation is required.

## Install layout

| What | Where |
|---|---|
| App files | `%LocalAppData%\Little Launcher\` |
| Start Menu shortcut | `%AppData%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Little Launcher.lnk` |
| Settings/data | `%AppData%\LittleLauncher\` (created by the app, not the MSI) |

## Start Menu shortcut lifecycle

1. **MSI creates** `Programs\Little Launcher.lnk` at install time using the embedded `LittleLauncher.ico` (always Blue rocket). This gives users something to click before the app ever runs.
2. **On first launch** `EnsureStartMenuShortcuts()` in `MainWindow.xaml.cs` overwrites the same shortcut with the user's chosen icon (`app-icon.ico` from AppData).
3. **On icon change** `UpdateShortcutIcons()` re-stamps the shortcut with the new icon.
4. **On uninstall** the MSI removes the shortcut via the component's registry key.

**Critical:** The MSI shortcut must be placed directly in `ProgramMenuFolder` (not a subfolder), so its path matches what the app writes at runtime. If the MSI uses a subfolder, you get duplicate shortcuts — one stale (MSI's) and one current (app's).

## Version injection

The installer version comes from `Directory.Build.props` → `LittleLauncherSetup.wixproj` passes `ProductVersion=$(Version).0` via `DefineConstants`. CI also injects it. A fallback `<?define ProductVersion = "X.Y.Z.0" ?>` exists in `Package.wxs` for local builds — **keep it in sync** when bumping versions.

## Upgrade behavior

`MajorUpgrade` with `AllowSameVersionUpgrades="yes"` handles upgrades and reinstalls — the old version is uninstalled before the new one is installed, even when the version number is unchanged. `UpgradeCode` must never change.

## Auto-launch after install

A `CustomAction` in `Package.wxs` launches `LittleLauncher.exe` after `InstallFinalize` (condition `NOT REMOVE`). It uses `asyncNoWait` so the installer doesn't block. This ensures the app is running in the tray immediately after a fresh install or upgrade.

## Per-user install notes

- `Scope="perUser"` means no elevation, installs to `LocalAppDataFolder`
- WiX ICE validations ICE38, ICE64, ICE91 are suppressed in `.wixproj` — these fire for per-user installs writing to profile directories, which is expected
- The update service (`UpdateService.cs`) launches `msiexec /i` without elevation (`-Verb RunAs` is NOT used)

## Auto-update flow

`UpdateService` downloads the MSI to a temp folder, removes the Zone.Identifier ADS (Mark of the Web), then spawns a `.cmd` helper script:

1. Script waits for the current app process to exit
2. Runs `msiexec /i <path> /passive` — installs silently with progress bar (no user interaction; they already consented in-app)
3. MSI's `CustomAction` auto-launches the app in the tray
4. Script launches `LittleLauncher.exe --settings` — the single-instance mutex detects the running app and sends `LittleLauncher_ShowSettings`, re-opening the Settings window

## MSIX / Store update flow

For packaged installs, `UpdateService` takes a separate path through `Windows.Services.Store.StoreContext` instead of GitHub Releases:

1. `CheckForUpdateAsync()` calls `GetAppAndOptionalStorePackageUpdatesAsync()` to detect Store updates
2. Home/About pages reuse the same cached result shape as the MSI path and keep the same single-action UI
3. Clicking `Download & Install` calls `RequestDownloadAndInstallStorePackageUpdatesAsync()` on the UI thread
4. The `StoreContext` is associated with the Settings window handle via `InitializeWithWindow.Initialize(...)` so Store consent dialogs are correctly owned in the desktop app
5. After the Store API reports success, `UpdateService` writes a small `.cmd` helper that waits for the current process to exit and then launches `explorer.exe shell:AppsFolder\<PackageFamilyName>!App`
6. The app exits, the helper relaunches the packaged app, and the normal default launch path reopens Settings

Only unpackaged installs show the custom update toast on startup. Packaged installs still prefetch update state at startup so Home/About can immediately surface available Store updates.

## Uninstall cleanup

Before file removal, WiX `util:CloseApplication` targets `LittleLauncher.exe` on `REMOVE="ALL"`. It sends a normal close message, then an end-session message, waits 5 seconds, and force-terminates the process if it is still running. This keeps explicit uninstalls and major-upgrade removal from racing the running tray process.

On `REMOVE="ALL" AND NOT UPGRADINGPRODUCTCODE`, a `CustomAction` runs `cleanup-uninstall.ps1` (shipped in the install folder) via `powershell.exe -File`. The `NOT UPGRADINGPRODUCTCODE` condition ensures settings and data survive upgrades. It cleans up:

| What | Where |
|---|---|
| App data folder | `%AppData%\LittleLauncher\` (settings, companion exe, icons) |
| Flyout Start Menu shortcut | `%AppData%\...\Start Menu\Programs\Little Launcher Flyout.lnk` |
| Startup registry entry | `HKCU:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\Little Launcher` |
| Pinned taskbar shortcuts | Any `.lnk` in `User Pinned\TaskBar\` targeting `LittleLauncherFlyout.exe` |

The action uses `Return="check"` so the uninstall does not report completion until the cleanup script has finished.

**MSIX limitation:** MSIX has no custom uninstall actions. When an MSIX package is removed, Windows deletes the package files, its own Start Menu entry, **and all VFS-redirected data** (settings, cached icons, companion exe) because the entire `%LocalAppData%\Packages\{PFN}\` tree is removed. Pinned taskbar shortcuts survive as dead `.lnk` files — Windows 11 eventually detects and offers to remove stale pins. Settings **do** survive MSIX upgrades — Windows preserves package data during version updates, including updates initiated through the Store API path above.
